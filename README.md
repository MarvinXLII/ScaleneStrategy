## ABOUT

This is a randomizer for Triangle Strategy. It is only compatible with
v1.0.3.

Play this at your own risk. I bear no responsibility if you or these
mods brick your Switch, etc.


## OPTIONS

See the executable for full descriptions of options. Options include:

* Random support skills for playable units (only works for New Game)
* Shuffling when playable units join your party
* Random unit/enemy starting positions in battles
* Shuffled unit/enemy intial turn order in battles
* Shuffled weather and time of day in battles
* Random item costs in shops
* Random number of items in shops
* Shuffled class promotion items
* Random weapon upgrade materials
* Random weapon ability pairing and preconditions

Quality of life options include:

* Reduced conviction requirements for voting
* Make Serenoa optional in Main Story battles


## USAGE

Download and run the executable from the Releases page. Load the pak
file `Newera-Switch.pak`, select your desired options, and when ready,
push the `Randomize` button. This will dump a mod in a folder
`seed_####`. To play, you can copy the contents of this folder
(omitting folder name `seed_####`) into the `atmosphere\contents`
folders on your Switch's SD card.


## KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS

* Deathless runs are not always possible if randomizing starting unit
  positions and turns orders in battles. Ally placements, aside from
  those you have to keep alive like Dragan, are not always well
  placed.

* Some pre-battle cutscenes can be affected by randomizing starting
  unit and enemy positions in battles. It can look bad, but it won't
  crash the game or interfere with exploration.

* Some sprite animations had to be modified to allow for shuffling
  sprites, e.g. not all sprites can kneel and will remain
  standing. You'll also see dummy sprites from time to time, typically
  sprites during fighting cutscenes.
